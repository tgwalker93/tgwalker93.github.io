              <p> Hi, my name is Tyler Walker and welcome to my site! I’ve had a deep passion for technology ever since I was a kid. Today, I love building web applications and I am learning every day. When it comes to coding, there’s no greater feeling in the world to me than solving a problem. Even if I have to spend an excessive amount of time solving it. It’s always hard for me to leave a problem unsolved, I’d rather not sleep. I am dedicated to translating my passion into a career. I am actively seeking job opportunities as a Web Developer. Currently my skills include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, jQuery, React, Node.js, AJAX, MySQL, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. </p>
        
              <p> Despite my passion in Technology, I was still confused about what I wanted to do with my life. I graduated in June from UC Irvine with a double major in Business Economics and Political Science. At the time, I felt that that I would do well in Finance, but it was never was something that I was into. I enjoyed following financial markets, but after realizing what my day to day job would entail, I began looking for alternative careers. I discovered my passion for coding when I took my first programming class in college. It was an Introduction to Python class, and I remember how excited I was for that class, even though it was hard.   </p>
              
                <p> After finishing my college degree, I was dedicated to switching my careers. I decided to get my Java Programming Certificate at the UCI Extension, which I finished on June 2017. I am currently going through the Full Stack Web Development program at the UCI Extension. I currently work at Auction.com (A Ten-X company) as a Contracts Specialist while I am looking for new opportunities as a web developer. Please feel free to contact with me with any questions!  </p>
